############################## The Verbs! ################################

### Select
select(surveys,      #the data
       weight)       #selects the weight column

#same as
tibble(surveys$weight)

#select multiple columns
select(surveys,      #the data
       plot_id,      #selects the plot_id column
       species_id,   #selects the species_id column
       weight)       #selects the weight column


### Filter
filter(surveys, year == 1995) 

#same as 
surveys[surveys$year == 1995, ]

#filter by multiple attributes

filter(surveys,          #the data
       year == 1995 &    #filter for rows that have 1995 in year column
         sex == "F")       #filter for rows that have F in the sex column

#same as 
surveys[surveys$year == 1995 & surveys$sex == "F", ]

###pipes
surveys %>%                             #the data then
  filter(weight < 5) %>%             #filter for rows where weight is less than 5 then
  select(species_id, sex, weight)  #select the species_id, sex, and weight columns


#Exercise #1: 
### Using pipes, subset the survey data to include individuals collected 
###     before 1995 and retain only the columns year, sex, and weight.

surveys %>%
  filter(year == 1995) %>%
  select(year, sex, weight)

#                   OR
surveys %>%
  select(year, sex, weight) %>%
  filter(year == 1995)

### Mutate
mutate(surveys,                          #the data
       weight_kg = weight / 1000)          #a new column definition
#creates a new column called weight_kg
#that holds the corresponding weight value / 1000

#same as
surveys %>%                              #the data
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) #see above 

# add 2 new columns at once
surveys %>%                              #the data
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000, #see above
         weight_kg2 = weight_kg *2) #creates a column called weight_kg2
#that holds the value weight_kg*2

##### Exercise 2 
#Create a new data frame from the survey data that meets the following criteria: 
# * contains only the species_id column and a new column called hindfoot_half containing 
# values that are half the hindfoot_length values. 
# * In this hindfoot_halfcolumn, there are no NAs and all values are less than 30.
#Hint: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!

surveys%>%
  filter(year>1990)%>%
  mutate(hindfoot_half = hindfoot_length/2) %>%
  select(species_id, hindfoot_half)

# create a summary of the weight variable
grouped_surveys<-surveys %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight,         #summary statistic
                               na.rm = TRUE))  #ignore NAs
#not very informative w/o group by

#group by then summarize creats a summary table
grouped_surveys<-surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%                            #categorical variable
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight,         #see
                               na.rm = TRUE))  #   above

#group by multiple variables
grouped_surveys<- surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%                #two categoriacl variables
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight,         #see
                               na.rm = TRUE))  #   above

#remove missing data with is.na
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%               #remove NAs
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%            #make rows for sex and species id
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))    #create mean_weight stat

#filtering makes it easy to calculate  multiple summary statistics
grouped_surveys<-surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))      #calculate a second stat

#Counting observations in categories

# count observation in each category
surveys %>%              #the data
  count(sex)             #variable to count by

#Same as
surveys %>%                 #the data
  group_by(sex) %>%         #the variable to coutn by
  summarize(count = n())    #summarize with the count function

# group by multiple variables
surveys %>%                 #the data
  count(sex,  species)      #count by 2 variables

#sort by 2 things
surveys %>%                      #the data
  count(sex,  species) %>%       #count by 2 variables
  arrange(species,               #arrange alphabetical
          desc(n))               #arrange descending

#How many individuals were caught in each plot_type surveyed?
#Use group_by() and summarize() to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length for each species (using species_id).

#You saw above how to count the number of individuals of each sex using a combination of group_by() and tally(). 
#How could you get the same result using group_by() and summarize()? Hint: see ?n.
